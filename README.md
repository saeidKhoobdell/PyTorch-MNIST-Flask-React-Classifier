# PyTorch MNIST Classifier with Flask and React

This repository showcases the end-to-end process of building, training, deploying, and serving a PyTorch-based classifier for the MNIST dataset. The trained model is deployed using Flask, providing a RESTful API endpoint for digit recognition. Additionally, a React web application enables users to upload images and visualize predictions from the deployed model.
