PyTorch MNIST Classifier with Flask and React
This repository demonstrates the process of building, training, deploying, and serving a PyTorch-based classifier for the MNIST dataset. The trained model is deployed using Flask, providing a RESTful API endpoint for digit recognition. Additionally, a React web application allows users to upload images and visualize predictions from the deployed model.
